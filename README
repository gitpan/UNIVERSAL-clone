NAME
    UNIVERSAL::clone - add clone method to all classes and objects

SYNOPSIS
     use UNIVERSAL::clone;

     $a = new Foo;
     $b = $a->clone();

     # or

     use UNIVERSAL::clone qw(Storable);    # use Storable::dclone
     use UNIVERSAL::clone qw(Clone);    # use Clone::clone (default)

DESCRIPTION
    Loading the UNIVERSAL::clone module adds clone method to all classes and
    methods. You can get a 'complete' copy of an object. See Storable or
    Clone perldoc for more details.

    Internally it just calls Clone::clone by default, but you can use
    standard (but slower) Storable module instead.
